How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories help by breaking down what users need into simple, manageable tasks that everyone can understand. They’re basically short simple descriptions of what the user wants, which makes it easier to stay focused on what’s important. By using user stories, I can prioritize what needs to be done and make sure the program is built to actually solve the user’s problems without getting too complicated.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When I’m working on programs, I like to dive into the toughest parts first. It helps me figure out any major challenges early on. Moving forward, I want to bring in a few Agile practices, like breaking down the work into smaller, more manageable chunks with sprints. I also think daily check-ins would be helpful to keep everyone on the same page, and I want to keep refining the program as I go with each iteration.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means staying in touch, being open to others’ ideas, and jumping in when there’s a problem to solve. It’s about working together, meeting deadlines, and sharing what you know with the team. A good team member is reliable, helps the team reach its goals, and keeps things positive and productive.
